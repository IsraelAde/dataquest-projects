# Transforming Data with Python

In this project, we'll be working with a dataset of submissions to Hacker News from 2006 to 2015. This is a website where users submit articles and other users upvote the articles to signify their like for them. The more upvotes, the more popular the submission was. 

This folder contains files created/used for the 'Transforming Data with Python' project at [www.dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/).

#### hn_stories.csv

  The csv file we're working with
  
#### read.py

  This script contains the function to read the csv and assign it to a dataframe along with its column names

#### count.py

  This script seperates each word in the 'headlines' column of the data and prints the 100 most common words

#### domains.py

  This script prints the 100 most submitted domains
  
#### times.py

  This script returns the number of sumbissions that occur over each hour
