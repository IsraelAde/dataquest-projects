    "It looks like high income survey participants (> 150k) actually stay home at a higher rate(48%) than lower income participants(< 150k)(41%). A reason for this may be that the high income survey participants are older and have their own families while the lower income participants may be made up of students who live on campus and travel home for thanksgiving. When we lower the income again (< 75K) we again see a reduction in the participants who stay at home (36%). This gives further weight to the suggestion that students make up a significant portion of the lower income participants. \n",
